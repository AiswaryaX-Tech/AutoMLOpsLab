# AutoMLOpsLab

**AutoMLOpsLab** is an open-source repository focused on automating the **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)** lifecycle by combining **AutoML** tools with **MLOps** best practices. The goal of this project is to streamline the end-to-end machine learning pipeline from model development to deployment, monitoring, and management with minimal manual intervention.

With **AutoMLOpsLab**, you can:
- Automatically select and tune machine learning models using AutoML tools.
- Seamlessly deploy models using MLOps pipelines.
- Monitor model performance in production and trigger retraining.
- Scale machine learning pipelines for efficient workflow automation.

## Features

- **AutoML Integration**: Leverage AutoML for automated model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
- **MLOps Pipelines**: Build scalable, repeatable pipelines for model deployment, monitoring, and management.
- **Model Monitoring**: Monitor models' performance in production and retrain when necessary.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for both small-scale and large-scale machine learning systems.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- Libraries such as `auto-sklearn`, `TPOT`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, `mlflow`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `flask` (list any other libraries specific to your project)

You can install the required libraries by using the `requirements.txt` file.
